**Predicting the NBA regular season MVP using regression and classification. An assessment of methods**  

<br>

The purpose of this project is to investigate different approaches within the Data Science discipline, that can be
used to predict the NBA regular season MVP. The approaches that were explored were by using regression
analysis and by converting the regression prediction problem into a binary classification problem. The algorithms
used in both cases achieved acceptable results. Finding the
best parameters for each model to help achieve the best
possible predictive results is something beyond the scope
of this project and therefore it was not explored in detail.
This should be taken under consideration when evaluating
the performance of the models at test.  

The stacking ensemble of regression algorithms achieved the best performance amongst the models tested based on regression
analysis.  
For the classification approach the Support Vector Machine classifier achieved the best results.  

Inside this repo you will find code artifacts and a report with its' corresponding presentation

Enjoy!
